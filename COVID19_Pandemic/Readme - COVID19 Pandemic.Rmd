***COVID-19 Pandemic in Kenya- a hypothetical situation***

**Usage**

Install necessary R libraries and run the R script in your preferred environment to simulate the epidemic and generate visualizations.

**Objective**

This project models and analyzes the impact of COVID-19 spread and the effectiveness of vaccination strategies in Kenya, using an SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) framework. It provides insights into epidemic dynamics and evaluates the role of public health interventions.

**Key Findings**

***1. Model Framework***

The SIR model was used, consisting of three compartments:
Susceptible (S): Individuals at risk of infection.
Infected (I): Actively infected individuals spreading the disease.
Recovered (R): Individuals who recovered and gained immunity.

**Transition rates**

Susceptible to Infected: 
β⋅S⋅I/N

Infected to Recovered: 
γ⋅I

***2. Simulation Results***

**Baseline Scenario (No Vaccination)**

Without vaccination, the infection curve peaked at approximately 10 million infected individuals around day 50.
The epidemic persisted for the entire simulation period, highlighting high healthcare demands.

**Vaccination Scenarios**

20% Vaccination Coverage (10 million individuals):
The infection peak reduced significantly.
Peak occurred later (day 83), and the infection rate dropped to nearly zero by day 150.
Highlights the flattening and delay of the epidemic curve.
40% Vaccination Coverage (20 million individuals):
The susceptible population dropped sharply.
Infection rate peaked earlier but was reduced to zero by day 75, indicating strong control of the epidemic.

***3. Transmission Rate (β)***

Role: Determines how quickly the disease spreads in the population.
Impact of Public Health Interventions:
Reducing β through strategies like vaccination, social distancing, mask-wearing, and hygiene reduces the spread and peak infections.
Effective interventions shift the dynamics, resulting in manageable epidemic curves and lower strain on healthcare systems.

***Visualizations***

Line Plots: Illustrated the trends in susceptible, infected, recovered, and vaccinated individuals across different scenarios.
Vaccination led to steady declines in susceptible individuals, reduced infection peaks, and increased immunity levels.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the critical role of vaccination and public health measures in controlling the COVID-19 epidemic in Kenya. Timely and widespread vaccination significantly flattens and shortens the epidemic, while reducing β through behavioral interventions is crucial in slowing disease spread. Together, these strategies ensure a sustainable and manageable healthcare response.
