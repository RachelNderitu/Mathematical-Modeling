Mathematical modeling is the process of using mathematical structures, equations, and algorithms to represent real-world systems or processes. 
It helps analyze, predict, and optimize behavior by simplifying complex scenarios into quantifiable and solvable frameworks, often using differential equations, statistical models, or computational simulations.
